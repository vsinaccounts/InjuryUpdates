SpankOdds RabbitMQ Injury Feed Instructions

The SpankOdds InjuryFeed uses RabbitMQ. We will provide you with a basic Java program to connect to our RabbitMQ server and read the data. If you decide to write your feed consumer in a different language, here is the essential information you need to get your connection:
Host: ec2-3-223-33-62.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Port: 5671
Username & Password: These are specific to you and will be sent to you along with these instructions. Do not share these with anyone since only one connection to your queue is allowed
Virtual Host: “InjuryFeed”
Queue Name: [your username] + “.InjuryQueue”
(Note: if your queue name differs slightly from this format, we will send it to you along with these instructions so you know)


The feed is sent in JSON format. The specific fields are:
{
  "Status": type: String – expected player status for this game,
  "Injury Type": type: String – reason for injury / injured body part,
  "Position": type: String – player’s position,
  "Team": type: String – name of team the player is on,
  "Rotation": type: Integer – rotation number the injury applies to,
  "Player Name": type: String – name of player,
  "League": type: String – which league this game is part of
}

Example:
{"Status":"DOWNGRADED TO DOUBTFUL","Injury Type":"Upper Body","Position":"G","Team":"Siena","Rotation":735,"Player Name":"Sean Durugordon","League":"NCAAB"}
